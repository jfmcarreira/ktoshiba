KToshiba TODO list
- Find another way to disable MousePad since the SCI call
	does not work with my toshiba model
- Finish the User-Settings Power saving mode
- Make the audio and video programs configurable and their
	options (currently only XMMS is supported as audio :( )
- Add support for more laptops
