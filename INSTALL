Requirements
==================
- A Toshiba laptop with a recent toshiba_acpi.ko
  kernel module
- Compiler and utilities (gcc, make, cmake, etc.)
- KDE libraries >= 4.3.x and development packages
- Additionally KToshiba depends on NetworkManager-KDE4,
  Solid, udev and the input.h kernel include.


NOTE: KToshiba grabs hotkeys via /dev/input/eventX
and uses D-Bus, Solid and ktoshhelper script to
perform the actions.



Installation
==================
If you have everything that is needed, then the install
process is very simple, extract the downloaded archive
and then type the following on a Konsole or Terminal:

cd ktoshiba-0.X.Y
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..
su -c "make install"


NOTE: Replace X and Y with the appropriate version numbers,
eg: ktoshiba-0.4.0



Post-Installation
==================
Once KToshia is installed, a few things must be done in
order to get it to work properly:

1 - Copy the udev rule (99-ktoshiba-input.rules), found in rules/udev
    to "/lib/udev/rules.d", create a new gruop named input and add
    your username to that group (a restart mught be needed...).
2 - Add a sudo rule to make the script ktoshhelper run under root
    privilegies in order to change leds, touchpad and brightness, etc..
