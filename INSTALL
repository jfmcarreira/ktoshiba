Requirements
==================
- A Toshiba laptop (see NOTE)
- Compiler and utilities (gcc, make, cmake, etc.)
- KDE libraries >= 4.3.x and development packages
- Additionally KToshiba depends on KDE4 workspace and
  libknotificationitem development packages as well.
- Optional, if you want to enable/disable the TouchPad
  you will need a recent XServer (>= 1.6.0) installed
  and also a recent synaptics_drv (>= 1.0)


NOTE: Since KToshiba uses HAL to get hotkeys and uses
D-Bus, Solid, and PowerDevil to perform the actions,
it is now possible to use any laptop with KToshiba,
as long as it has a kernel driver that reports events
via the input layer.



Installation
==================
If you have everything that is needed, then the install
process is very simple, extract the downloaded archive
and then type the following on a Konsole or Terminal:

cd ktoshiba-0.X.Y
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..
su -c "make install"


NOTE: Replace X and Y with the appropriate version numbers,
eg: ktoshiba-0.4.0

NOTE2: Optional, you can add the configure parameter
-DENABLE_TOUCHPAD_FUNCTIONALITY=1
in order to Enable/Disable the TouchPad
