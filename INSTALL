Requirements
============
- A Toshiba laptop with a recent toshiba_acpi.ko
  kernel module (kernel >= 4.0 recommended)
- Compiler and utilities (gcc, make, cmake, etc.)
- KF5 libraries and development packages
- Extra CMake Modules (ECM)
- LibUDev and development packages
- Linux input.h kernel include


NOTE: KToshiba grabs hotkeys via /dev/input/eventX
and uses D-Bus and ktoshhelper to perform the actions.



Installation
============
If you have everything that is needed, then the install
process is very simple, extract the downloaded archive
and then type the following on a Konsole or Terminal:

cd ktoshiba-X.Y
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DKDE_INSTALL_PLUGINDIR=/usr/lib64/qt5/plugins -DKDE_INSTALL_QTPLUGINDIR=/usr/lib64/qt5/plugins ..
su -c "make install"


NOTE: Replace X and Y with the appropriate version numbers,
eg: ktoshiba-5.0



Post-Installation
=================
Once KToshiba is installed, a restart is needed to activate the new
udev rules, or you can simply do the following (as root):

1 - Reload the udev rules (udevadm control --reload-rules).
2 - Activate the new rules (udevadm trigger).
