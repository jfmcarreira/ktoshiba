Requirements
============
- A Toshiba laptop with a recent toshiba_acpi.ko
  kernel module (kernel >= 3.15 recommended)
- Compiler and utilities (gcc, make, cmake, etc.)
- KDE libraries >= 4.6.x and development packages
- Additionally KToshiba depends on Solid, udev
  and the input.h kernel include.


NOTE: KToshiba grabs hotkeys via /dev/input/eventX
and uses D-Bus and ktoshhelper to perform the actions.



Installation
============
If you have everything that is needed, then the install
process is very simple, extract the downloaded archive
and then type the following on a Konsole or Terminal:

cd ktoshiba-0.X.Y
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..
su -c "make install"


NOTE: Replace X and Y with the appropriate version numbers,
eg: ktoshiba-0.4.0



Post-Installation
=================
Once KToshiba is installed, a restart is needed to activate the new
udev rules, or you can simply do the following (as root):

1 - Reload the udev rules (udevadm control --reload-rules).
2 - Activate the new rules (udevadm trigger).
