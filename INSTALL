Requirements
============
- A Toshiba laptop with a recent toshiba_acpi.ko
  kernel module (kernel >= 4.5 recommended)
- Compiler and utilities (gcc, make, cmake, etc.)
- KF5 libraries and development packages
- Extra CMake Modules (ECM)
- Libmnl (Minimalistic NetLink library)


NOTE: KToshiba grabs hotkeys and Toshiba specific events via
netLink and uses D-Bus, ktoshhelper and /dev/toshiba_acpi device
to perform the actions.



Installation
============

openSUSE Build Service (OBS)
----------------------------
For openSUSE users (13.2 and Leap), I have precompiled packages
under my OBS home project for KToshba and an updated toshiba_acpi
kernel module, simply run as root (or sudo):

zypper ar -f -c http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/Coproscefalo/openSUSE_%version

Replacing %version with your current openSUSE version, once done
simply run as root (or sudo):

zypper in ktoshiba toshiba_acpi-kmp

And zypper will take care of pulling all needed dependencies.


SOURCE
------
If you have everything that is needed, then the install
process is very simple, extract the downloaded archive
and then type the following on a Konsole or Terminal:

cd ktoshiba-X.Y
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
su -c "make install"


NOTE: Replace X and Y with the appropriate version numbers,
eg: ktoshiba-5.0



Post-Installation
=================
Once KToshiba is installed, a restart is needed to activate the new
udev rule, or you can simply do the following (as root):

1 - Reload the udev rules (udevadm control --reload-rules).
2 - Activate the new rules (udevadm trigger).
