KToshiba
========
KToshiba features a Graphical User Interface (UI) highly integrated with KDE,
managing those function keys not handled by KDE (Screen lock, TouchPad toggle,
Battery profiles, Zoom keys and Keyboard backlight).

Also provides a System Settings module for easy access and configuration of
Toshiba laptops related hardware like TouchPad, Accelerometer, Keyboard
backlight, Sleep Utilities and more.

license can be found in a file named COPYING, in the toplevel directory.



Installation
============
For installation instructions, please see the file named INSTALL, found in
the top level directory.



Usage
=====
If installation went right you can find KToshiba under the Utilities menu,
click on it and then an icon should appear on the taskbar, and your extra
function keys are now being monitored and appropriate actions are executed.

Click (or right click) on it and a menu will appear where you have three
choices, Quit, Configure and Battery Profiles.
- Quit: Quits the application (self explanatory).
- Configure: A new window should appear (a KCModule) where you can configure
  the hardware available to your laptop (greyed out items means your laptop
  has no support for it), you can also access this module in the System
  Settings, under the Hardware category.
- Battery Profiles: Here you can change to the four different battery profiles
  available (Performance, Powersave, Presentation, ECO) or simply disable the
  feature.
