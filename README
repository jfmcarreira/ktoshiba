KToshiba
=====
KToshiba is currently covered under the GPL version 2 or later. A copy of this
license can be found in a file named COPYING, in the toplevel directory.

What it is
=====
KToshiba is a KDE monitor for the special keys found on Toshiba laptops
such Fn-Key combos and the Multimedia keys found on the front panel.

This program have been tested on a Satellite(R) A25-S279 model,
newer Satellite(R) models may work also with this program since
the Fn-Keys are the same as I have seen, but I haven't tested them.

Requirements
=====
- A Toshiba laptop (this is a must)
- Compiler and utilities (autoconf, automake, etc.)
- KDE 3.2.x and development libraries
- alsa-utils package (for muting/unmuting)

Preparatives
=====
For the program to function properly you need to specify the port for 
the Fn key at the moment of kernel module insertion 
('insmod toshiba tosh_fn=0x62'). 
Currently only two port locations are known for the Fn key 0x62 and 0x68, 
you can try these numbers until you find one that does work.

If no problems arise when you do 'insmod toshiba tosh_fn=0x62'
then you will be able to see something like this if you type
'cat /proc/toshiba' then you are all set.

	1.1 0xfcf8 2.82 1.10 0x24ca 0x00

If you found a port number that works for you, you might want to automate
this instead of having to type it in everytime (yes I'm kinda lazy).
So basically what you need to do is to edit modules.conf or modprobe.conf
depending on your running kernel, look for a line containing the following:

	alias char-major-10-181 toshiba

then just add the following "options toshiba tosh_fn=0x62"
without the cuotes and it should look something like this:

	alias char-major-10-181 toshiba
	options toshiba tosh_fn=0x62

If you are using SuSE you might want to add this to modules.conf.local or
modprobe.conf.local (again depending on running kernel) instead.

Installation
=====
If you have everything that is needed then installation is very
simple, extract the downloaded archive and then type the following: 

	cd ktoshiba-0.X 		(where X is the current version number)
	./configure --prefix=/path/to/kde3/directory (on SuSE /opt/kde3)
	make
	su -c "make install"	(this step will need the root password)

or if you downloaded an rpm then do the following:

	rpm -ivh ktoshiba-0.X.i386.rpm 	(this has to be done as root)

Usage
=====
If installation went right you can find KToshiba under the Utilities menu
click on it and then an icon should appear on the taskbar, right-click on it
and select configure, a new window should appear where you can set some values
such as battery poll time, select audio application to use with front panel
buttons etc. 

Support, Bugs & Requests
=====
I have plans to add more support to other Toshiba models in the
future, if you liked this program and wish to have support for your
Toshiba laptop send an e-mail to neftali@utep.edu and include the
Fn-Key combos available on your laptop and what they do (eg: Fn-F1
LockScreen or Fn-F7 Brightness Up).

If you have found a bug or want some features on a future release
please send an email to the below e-mail address with the description
of the problem or the feature request, or simply go to the sourceforge.net
project page and report the bug or wish there.
