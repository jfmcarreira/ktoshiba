KToshiba
=====
KToshiba is currently covered under the GPL version 2.  A copy of this
license can be found in a file named COPYING, in the toplevel directory.

What it is
=====
KToshiba is a KDE monitor for the special keys found on Toshiba laptops
such Fn-Key combos and the Multimedia keys found on the front panel.

This program have been tested on a Satellite(R) A25-S279 model,
newer Satellite(R) models may work also with this program since
the Fn-Keys are the same as I have seen, but I haven't tested them.

Requirements
=====
- A Toshiba laptop (this is a must)
- Compiler and utilities (autoconf, automake, etc.)
- KDE 3.1.x and development libraries
- The Powersave daemon and Libraries (for STR and STD)
- A lot of courage

Support
=====
I have plans to add more support to other Toshiba models in the
future, if you liked this program and wish to have support for your
Toshiba laptop send an e-mail to neftali@utep.edu and include the
Fn-Key combos available on your laptop and what they do (eg: Fn-F1
LockScreen or Fn-F7 Brightness Up).
