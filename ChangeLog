	* Changed code to use Amarok's PlayPause D-Bus
	  call (introduced on Beta 2)

2009-09-20 Azael Avalos <coproscefalo@gmail.com>

	  action if it is not running yet

2009-08-22 Azael Avalos <coproscefalo@gmail.com>
	* Moved some of the Media Player functions to
	  FnActions class instead (KToshibaDBusInterface
	  should only deal with D-Bus calls)

2009-08-11 Azael Avalos <coproscefalo@gmail.com>
	* AutoStart is now working, implemented basic
	  configuration file
